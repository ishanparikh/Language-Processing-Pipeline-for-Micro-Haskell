# Language-Processing-Pipeline-for-Micro-Haskell
The objective of this practical is to illustrate the language processing pipeline in the case of a small but interesting fragment of the Haskell programming language, which we shall call Micro-Haskell.  The practical illustrates all stages of the language processing pipeline for program- ming languages, taking us from a source file, written in MH, to execution of the program. In our case, the pipeline has four stages: lexing, parsing, typechecking and evaluation. Your task is to provide language-specific material to assist with the first three stages: lexing, covered in Part A of the practical; parsing, covered in Part B; and typechecking, covered in Part C. A simple evaluator is provided for you.
